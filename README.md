# Cafe √† la Mode ‚òï
Cafe √† la Mode is a virtual cafe designed to help students and people relax while working on projects, assignments, etc. This is a passion project of mine as a student who contantly needs to be in a calm and collected state of mind. The virtual cafe provides hours of jazz and bossanova music as you work. During breaks, the virtual cafe has non-intensive minigames for you to play around with until you are ready to get back to work!

## Features

- Hours of Jazz/Bossanova music üé∂
- Cat cursor minigame üêà
- Chalkboard doodling minigame üñçÔ∏è
- Personally drawn vector art üé®

## Tool Overview

The initial screen will be the exterior design of the virtual cafe. Pressing the start button will take you to the interior design of the cafe where the music will start playing. You are able to stop or play the music in the top left hand corner based on your own descretion. There will be a button corresponding to the cat and the chalkboard inside the cafe which will take you to the minigames. The cat minigame will be a cat following your cursor from left to right. If the cursor is not moving the cat will also be idle and sit. You can also scale the cat up and down using the up and down keys. As for the doodling minigame, you can doodle as much as you want on the chalkboard. There is an erasing option as well as clear board. These games are non-intensive and will help with providing a short break.
